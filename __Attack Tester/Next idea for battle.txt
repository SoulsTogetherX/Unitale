Do the sans muliverse battle.

Have it start off as the requrel sans fight, even advertise it like "The sans fight...?," unitl you hit sans 2 times, then he will start a new attack with a little new dilong hinting at what's to come. Then a new sans comes to fight in the next attack (dosen't need the player to fight sans anymore to progress) in which both snases combinablities (preferably underfell sans frist). In every attack, every new sans introduced must add something to the battle always!

Keep consitant with each charater. For example, you can have one round in which sans says (during an attack and with a scochked face) that, that is a lot of bones and he doesn't know how to contribute anymore. Then another sans can say (preferably blue berry sans) to just put random bones anyway, and so sans does that. 

How to kill them? Introduce say glichtale or virse sans, which will kill everyone else, and you will only have to kill them.
