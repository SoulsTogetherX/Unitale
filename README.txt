These are a few old battles I made, using the Unitale Code engine and long, long time ago. Made or may not still work with the current CYF engine.

Grammer mistakes and messy code are do to my inexperience back in the day. May work on a few things here and there.



Note: I failed to update these, so a lot of error and bugs may be in them now, according to version differences.
