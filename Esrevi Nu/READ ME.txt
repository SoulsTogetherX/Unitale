Imagine if I was smart enough to make those ! and ? into a code. *Nervous laugh* Hahaha... Hint, hint.

Not really, I don't know where I would even start. I guess binary would be a good start, but they are so many different types of codes out there!

For example, you could put it in morse code, then afterwards in a Caesar Shift Cipher, in which can be converted into binary, so that you can change it with Steganography, then something else...

I don't know, I was making it up as I went...
